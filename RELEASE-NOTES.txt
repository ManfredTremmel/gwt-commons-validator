BUGS FROM PREVIOUS RELEASE
===========================

 * [VALIDATOR-266] - DomainValidator uses an O(n) method where an O(1) would be
                     more appropriate. Thanks to Bruce Collie.

                     Thanks to Chris Lee.

                     Thanks to Arūnas Bendoraitis.
 * [VALIDATOR-317] - DomainValidator missing sTLD - "xxx".
                     Thanks to Arūnas Bendoraitis.
 * [VALIDATOR-327] - Missing sx tld.
                     Thanks to Arūnas Bendoraitis.
 * [VALIDATOR-331] - IBANCheckDigitTest.createInvalidCodes(String[] codes) uses
                     wrong values.
 * [VALIDATOR-336] - CUSIPCheckDigit thinks invalid CUSIP is valid.
 * [VALIDATOR-345] - ISINCheckDigit fails to reject invalid (non-numeric) check
                     digits
 * [VALIDATOR-346] - SedolCheckDigit fails to reject invalid (non-numeric) check
                     digits
 * [VALIDATOR-347] - toLowerCase() method is Locale-sensitive and should not be
                     used

                     Thanks to Rashid Rashidov
 * [VALIDATOR-297] - Punycode url is not valid. Top-level domain regex matching
                     was wrong; e.g. it did not allow embedded "-"  per RFC2396
 * [VALIDATOR-308] - Logical errors in util.Flags affecting check of multiple
                     flags as well as flag 64
                     Thanks to Til Boerner

                     Removed "root" from TLD list. 
                     Also "um" and "yu" as they are currently "Not assigned"
 * [VALIDATOR-306] - DomainValidator accepts labels longer than 63 chars and domain name lengths exceeding 255 chars
                     Thanks to Jukka Timonen
 * [VALIDATOR-339] - URLValidator fails validating domain names with a trailing period, which are valid.
                     Thanks to Alex Blume

                     Thanks to Brian Preuß

IMPROVEMENTS OVER PREVIOUS RELEASE

                     and not IPV6

                     Thanks to Sam Cooley

 * [VALIDATOR-344] - AbstractCheckDigit class does not fully test invalid strings
                     Fix up the testCalculateInvalid() invalid method to allow for 
                     either invalid checksum or syntax (CheckDigitException) error
                     when testing the entries in the invalid array.
 * [VALIDATOR-290] - Create new url validation using rfc3986 and IDN - added new test
                     Thanks to  Alexander Rytov
 * [VALIDATOR-349] - TLD tables should be pre-sorted
 * [VALIDATOR-342] - URLValidator returns false for http://example.rocks
                     Thanks to Donal Murtagh
